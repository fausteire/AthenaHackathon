# AthenaHackathon

This repository is a prototype for our October Athena Hackathon Idea. This is just a rough idea of what we can do with data and how we can present it. 

### About the hackathon.

Blackrock - Improving financial inclusivity

For this theme, you'll need to consider 👇

💼 Business Case  - Is the idea innovative? Is it sustainable, both financially and environmentally? We are looking for a solution that has meaningful impact.

🧐 User Experience - An idea is great, but it must feel right to the user too. What's the experience they go through as part of the solution? We want people to gain value, without any pain. We are looking for a solution that is easily adopted, even enjoyable!

💻 Presentation - This time the initial submissions won’t require a video! However, you’ll still need to provide a presentation that should be clear, concise and show people why this solution is the one that will change the market and convey your competitive advantage.

🚀 Execution - What's behind the scenes of your implementation? We are looking at how you architect your solution, the choices you have made along the way, and for solid foundations that can easily scale.

### About our solution.

A third of adults around the world still remain unbanked: whether it’s women who rely on their partner for finances or minorities which don’t have access to banking.
Among those who bank, it is still difficult for people to find guidance on investment and is intimidating for people to make confident decisions. According to a report by Blackrock, among 26k people who have history investing, 49% of them are not confident in making decisions.
In addition, financial markets are rapidly changing, with developments in technology and new financial products. It is hard for people to keep up with the changes and make according changes in investment decisions.

• Build application that helps users to make smart and deliberate financial decisions
Application Aim: 
- allow users to compare and understand various investments opportunities.
- make conscious choice of investment.
- learn key criteria to focus on when selecting investment.
